# READ ME
Hey I'm Bella and I am bold enough to (in the past) install triple boot Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, and Linux From Scratch, I daily drive Arch and am more comfotable with Gentoo now after using it on a laptop aswell to "get outta my room". On the LFS note I do not have it installed now but recently I have started and haven't yet got to the real tricky stuff yet(I now use LUKS and LVM)

I was inspired by Alex's([Voklen/Voklen](https://github.com/Voklen/Voklen)) "about self code" and am making something similar

```c
printf("Hello World!");
```
